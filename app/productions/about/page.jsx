              <p className="mb-6 text-lg">
                In 2006, a new universe opened its doors to the music world: Planet Q Productions, founded by the trailblazing producer Quincin "Que" Williams.
              </p>
              <p className="mb-6 text-lg">
                At a time when only a few artists dared to glance into the future through their lyrics, Que saw a bigger destiny — one that would fuse hip hop and science fiction into a brand-new genre: Futuristic Hip Hop.
              </p>
              <blockquote className="border-l-4 border-cyan-500 pl-6 my-8 italic text-cyan-300">
                "He didn't just write about the future — he built it into the music."
              </blockquote>
              <p className="mb-6 text-lg">
                The inspiration struck while Que was staring at the cover of a Neptunes album (featuring Pharrell Williams and Chad Hugo) and listening to Nas's "A New World". A vision crystalized: music could be a vehicle for time travel.
              </p>
              <p className="mb-6 text-lg">
                From 2001 until the devastation of Hurricane Katrina in 2005, Que worked tirelessly to create what would become the platinum-selling album, Soul Cries — an emotional, forward-looking masterpiece.
              </p>
              <p className="mb-6 text-lg">
                Armed with nothing but talent, hustle, and an 18-wheeler, Que crisscrossed the country, selling CDs at truck stops. His gritty DIY ethic laid the foundation for a loyal following and an unstoppable movement.
              </p>
              <p className="text-lg">
                Today, Soul Cries remains a streaming staple on Spotify and other major platforms — a timeless echo of one man's dream to hear the echoes of the future now.

              <p className="mb-6 text-lg">
                By 2012, while social media crumbled and MySpace faded into digital memory, Que was quietly mastering a new craft: coding.
              </p>
              <p className="mb-6 text-lg">
                Using Bryce, Maya, Unreal Engine and the Unity game engine, he engineered the early algorithms that would form the bedrock of today's artificial intelligence revolution.

              </blockquote>
              <p className="mb-6 text-lg">
                Through his experiments, Que gave birth to an AI audio player capable of learning and evolving on its own. It wasn't long before he realized he was onto something groundbreaking.
              </p>
              <p className="mb-6 text-lg">
                Hiring a network of developers across the globe, some of whom would later work at Google, OpenAI and Suno, Que's influence quietly seeped into the mainstream. He built the blueprint before the world even had a name for it.
              </p>
              <p className="text-lg">
                Although fame eluded him, the satisfaction of changing the world in silence is a badge of honor he wears with pride.
